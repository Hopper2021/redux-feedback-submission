# Feedback Submission

## Description

This single page application allows users to submit feedback to a database that can later be reviewed. 

Users are asked to answer 4 questions with a value between 1 and 5:

- How are you feeling today?
- How well are you understanding the content?
- How well are you being supported?
- Would you like to leave any comments?

The first 3 pages will not allow blank values, or values not between 1 and 5. Comments input however can be left blank if the user chooses to.

The back buttons will bring you to the previous pages if you want to change your values.
